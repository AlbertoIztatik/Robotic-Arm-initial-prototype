Note: I personally believe it would be a more efficient allocation of time to redesign from scratch keeping the below issues   
in mind rather than going through this list and trying to touch up the exist CAD files (but feel free to use my designs how  
you see fit).

1.0 Functionality
  1.1 Fingers
    •	Use stronger elastic, the thin strands I used have a tendency to break
    •	Wider hole for the elastic to be fed thru
    •	Not all the black finger pieces fit snuggly on the white ones, this prevents smooth rotation of the fingers and   
      consequently sometimes the tension in the elastic isn’t enough to pull them back to rest and they get stuck.
    •	Potentiometers in the knuckle are ineffective as the top segment of the finger (where the finger nail would be) tends to  
      bend first, followed by the second, meaning no reading is collected until the segment closest to the palm starts rotating.  
      Thus if something blocks the segment closest to the palm, you have no knowledge of the position of the top two segments,
      they will begin rotating why the potentiometer reads the finger is at rest, fully extended. To overcome this you could  
      design a way to have IMU's in the different segments of the finger, or potentiometers in each of the points of rotation  
      (both of which I don't see as being practical, given the space restraints and the number of wires required to fit) or  
      a motor encoder to track how many revolutions the motor makes.
    •	Ideally I would actuate the pinky and ring fingers separately, but not of vital importance since you rarely need to move  
      one without moving the other one.
    •	Tying knot in end of elastic is almost impossible while keeping it taught, had to set for super glue instead. 
  1.2 Thumb
    •	Axle it spins on is too loose, this would be a pretty simple fix though
    •	When the finger is contracted, the finger begins to rotate as well as being contracted because the axle mount on the thumb  
      rotation servo is too loose, the simple fix would be using a bit of epoxy or superglue.
    •	The thumb contraction has no postition feedback, this is perhaps the most serious issue with this design as it can only be 
      controlled by sight or else it will over contract, breaking either the servo or the thumb. Solutions to this could involve;
      some sort of mount for a potnetiometer in the thumb to read the position, use of a reference IMU or perhaps a redesign of how 
      the servos controlling the hand such as using a motor encoder to data log the rotations.
    •	Some of the issues of the fingers mentioned above, translate also into the thumb
  1.3 Servos 
    ¬	Continuous Rotation servos (Index and Thumb Contraction)
      •	Biggest issue is lose of rotation issue as discussed above, better to use small, geared motors with a motor encoder.
      •	Occassionally the fishing line can slip off the pulleys, especially if the fishing line is not under constant tension 
      •	Because the fishing line can wrap around the pulley in both directions, if you are trying to relax the finger by 
        unwinding the pulley and the finger gets stuck (as mentioned above due to coarse joints) the pulley can keep rotating  
        to the point the fishing line starts wrapping around the pulley in the opposite direction, resulting in the finger being  
        contracted without ever fully relaxing (since the pots only measure knuckle rotation and have no info on the top two segments)
    ¬	Compressed 2-in-1 continuous rotation geared dc motors
      •	For the most part this design worked extremely well (since it is "technically" the same as a normal servo, see comments  
        in instructable link for explanation) the biggest issue was my, axle substitute is too narrow, resulting in large   
        vibrations in the gears, later damaging the plastic teeth of the gears actuating the pinky/ring finger combination. Had I  
        found an axle of perfect diameter I believe this would be a null issue.
    ¬	Thumb rotation servo
      •

  1.4 Palm
    •	Thumb contraction servo is free to move, no enough support walls
    •	Middle finger contraction servo pulley is too close to the wall, has a lot of friction.
    •	The fishing line holes for fingers
    •	Hard to service/ take apart if any of the servos break/ fishing line gets twisted.
  1.5 Wrist
    •	While the wrist functions well (I tested it with higher torque servos) it probably won’t work well and may break (depending on the spring and servo strength) if the hand is holding anything of significant weight.
    Several design flaws:
    •	Of the 4 screw holes used for mounting the servos only one can be reached (oversight on my part), instead use glue
    •	The servo responsible for left/right motion (ie waving) could easily be torn out of its mount, instead I should have put a wall on the other side to prevent it from pulling itself out under its own rotation.
    •	The servos are too weak to actually rotate the wrist (at least for the springs I used), so this step is actually kinda redundant, since it won't move.
    •	
  1.6 Forearm
    •	The forearm should be made wider so larger, high torque servos such as Kuman MG996 can fit inside without the armatures hitting the walls.
    •	Redesigned so the hand can rotate around the forearm axis while the base of the forearm near the elbow remains stationary.
    •	The black piece of the forearm needs to have its edges trimmed for a smoother fit inside the white pieces
    •	Magnets
  1.7 3D printing issues and CAD file issues

2.0 Aesthetics 
  •	The section where the knuckles meet the palm needs to be smoothed out
  •	The knuckles of a normal human hand arch [1] with the middle knuckle being at the peak of the arch, whereas mine is a linear progression from pinky being the lowest to the highest being the index
  •	Perhaps some covers for the screws in the palm
3.0 Additional
  •	Arduino Nano
  •	In redesign I would like to try using mechanical fingers over fishing line and wires see [2] & [3]
  •	Use rechargeable lipos 
  •	One hand is assembled it is hard and time consuming to repair or replace parts that break inside the palm
